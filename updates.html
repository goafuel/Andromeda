            <h1>Minecraft Trails and Tales Update</h1>
            <p>Minecraft 1.20, also known as the Trails and Tales update, is a major update that focuses on creativity
                and self-expression through representation and storytelling. The update introduces new features, blocks,
                mobs, and biomes that will enhance your Minecraft experience and allow you to share your stories with
                the world.</p>
                <h3>New Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cherry Blossom Biome: A rare and beautiful biome that features pink cherry blossom leaves, cherry tree saplings, wood set, and flower carpet blocks. You can also find cherry blossom honey, which has special properties.</li>
                   <p></p>
                    <li>Sniffer: A cute and helpful mob that was once extinct, but can now be brought back to the Overworld. You can find its eggs in archaeology sites, hatch them, and tame them with seeds. The sniffer will dig up seeds for you to plant, and can also sniff out hidden treasures and secrets.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Armor Trim: A customization option that lets you show off your style and achievements. You can find Armor trim templates in various places, such as dungeons, temples, and villages. You can use the smithing table to craft and dye different trims for your armour, and mix and match them to create your own look.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Camel: A majestic and useful mob that can be found in deserts and savannas. You can saddle, tempt, and breed camels with hay bales. Camels can carry two chests, and have a unique ability to store water and drink from cauldrons. They are also immune to cactus damage and sandstorms.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Bamboo Block: A versatile and renewable resource that can be used for crafting and building. You can find bamboo in jungles and bamboo forests, or grow it yourself with bamboo shoots. Bamboo can be used to make bamboo planks, sticks, fences, doors, and more. You can also craft the mosaic block, which is perfect for flooring, and the bamboo raft, which is faster and more durable than a boat.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Archaeology: A new mechanic that lets you explore the history and secrets of the Minecraft world. You can find archaeology sites in various biomes, where you can dig and brush sand blocks to reveal pottery sherds, fossils, and other artifacts. You can also use clay pots to store and display your findings, or craft them into decorative blocks.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Hanging Signs: A new way to display your messages and signs. You can hang signs beneath or on the side of any block, using any wood type you want. You can also use dye to change the color of the text and the sign itself.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Mob Heads: An item that lets you imitate the sounds of different mobs. You can find mob heads in archaeology sites, or get them as rare drops from mobs. You can wear them as helmets, or place them on armour stands. When you wear or activate a mob head, you will make the sound of that mob, which can be useful for communication or pranks.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Chiselled Bookshelf: A new block that lets you store and organize your books. You can craft it with a bookshelf and a chisel, or find it in libraries and villages. The chiselled bookshelf can hold up to 16 books, which you can access by right-clicking. You can also use the chisel to change the appearance of the bookshelf, and add labels or decorations.</li>
                    <p></p>

                    <li>Book and Quill: A new item that lets you write and edit your own books. You can craft it with a book, a feather, and an ink sac, or find it in chests and archaeology sites. The book and quill can hold up to 50 pages, which you can write on with different fonts, colours, and styles. You can also add images, links, and commands to your books, and share them with other players.</li>
                </ul>
